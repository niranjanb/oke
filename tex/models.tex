\section{Salience and Dependence Models}

\subsection{Salience}

\subsection{Dependence}

\textbf{Not temporal} but dependence as it simplifies the needs with respect to end tasks (temporal ordering of events is useful in its own right) but that is not the focus here.

\textbf{What features to use?}

\subsection{Evaluation}

\textbf{Intrinsic evaluation} via predictive tasks. 


\subsection{Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Formal models for estimating salience and dependence.
\item Empirical evaluation of the intrinsic quality of the models. 
\end{itemize}
