\section*{Data Management Plan}
The main data generated as part of the project are the curated schemas. The collected data will only include the annotations on the schema and will not include any information about the annotators themselves. The data collection will proceed only after obtaining the appropriate Institution Review Board approvals. The data will be stored in Stony Brook servers and will be released to the community. We will also release all the software developed as part of the project for the wider community to use.
