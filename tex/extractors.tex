\section{Event Extraction}

Templates specify slots for extracting information about events or scenarios. For example, the following is an arrest template, which specifies the relevant pieces of extractable information about typical arrest events. 
\begin{table}[htdp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{2cm}|p{8cm}|p{4cm}|}
\hline
Slot & Description & Value\\
\hline
Agent & The authority that makes the arrest. & {\em London Police}\\
Suspect & The person who was arrested. & {\em John Doe}\\
Crime & The charge under which someone is arrested. & {\em robbery}\\
Court  & The court where the suspect was produced. & {\em 8th District court, DC} \\ 
Victim & The victim of the crime & {\em Jane Eyre}\\
Lawyer & The lawyer representing the suspect. & {\em Fullerson}\\
\hline
Time & Time of arrest & Sept 18, 2014\\
Location & Place arrested & Suspect's home\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\end{table}%

The schemas we generate include similar information and can be used to effectively guide extraction about events or scenarios. 
Recall that schemas specify the main entities and their roles as a set of generalized relations between the participants in events. 
Each generalized relation in a schema specifies an extraction pattern and thus the schema as a whole can be viewed as a high precision extractor. Our investigation shows that coverage of the extraction patterns is a key issue and using the schema as is will result in low recall. 

As part of this work we will investigate methods that bootstrap extractors from the schemas. The original extractions from schemas are linked to the original extractions from which they were constructed

Event extraction then becomes the task of aggregating the relations into event mentions. This is a two step process, where we first identify the schema that is to be invoked given the relations in the document and then mapping the relations and the entities into the schema. 

%We can construct extractors for each relation independently and then learn a joint model from the individual extractors, which respects consistency constraints specified over the schema. For example, in an arrest schema, we expect that the agent of a "arrest" relation to be different from the agent of a "appeared in court" relation. Similarly, we expect that the object of the "arrest" relation to be also the object of the "charged with" relation. 

The other key challenge in template-based event extraction is identifying the boundaries of events. Often times, multiple events of the same type are discussed. For example, a news article about a specific arson incident will often refer to previous arson incidents in the same area, which can potentially confuse extraction. This is a hard problem that is unlikely to be so
