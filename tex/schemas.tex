\subsection{Contributions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Effective representation which captures adequate context to unambiguously represent event semantics. 
\item Generalization techniques that address sparsity. 
\item Graph-based approaches that leverage graphical properties to address sense and topic-drift. 
\item Scalable method for effectively scoring generated schemas. 
\end{itemize}
